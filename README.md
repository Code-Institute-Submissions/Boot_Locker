# Boot Locker

**About** I have based my project on a webapp that sells Soccer and Rugby boots.I plan to create a clear , easy and well structured web application
so that Soccer and Rugby enthusiast can find the perfect pair of boots.

**Personal Reasons For Creating This Web Application**
* Trying to find the perfect pair of boots was a long and tedious task when i was younger. Going from shop to shop with my father and not
  really having any idea what boots i was actually looking for.
* My brother has three boys who love playing and watching football. Every six months or so they are asking my brother for a new pair of boots.
  My brother would ask "What pair do you want?" and the answer was always the same "What ever pair Messi or Ronaldo are wearing".

So with all this in mind i decided to build Boot Locker, to take the pain and stress out of finding the perfect pair of boots.

**Business Opportunities**
* Making a percentage of the profit on every pair of boots sold on the app.
* Advertising for different sports
* Advertising for sports brands like Adidas and Nike for example.
* Advertising for teams that are looking for new talent.
* Advertising for Colleges who are offering scholarships.

**Users Benefits**
* The ability to find and buy boots without having to leave the comfort of their homes.
* They are able to create an account and keep track of their sending.
* They will be able to see all of their purchase history.
* They can see what pair of boots the top player are wearing.
